## What's that?

A little while ago, I was thinking about what it would be like to
develop a programming language (compiled or interpreted) and I spent
a lot of time thinking about `Strings` ðŸ¤”

Things like `'\0'` terminator, diffs between `char []` and `char *`.
Update object fields during changing/reading meaning values...

So, I take a time to study and share knowledge about
`C lang Strings` ðŸ”—
