Cool String type concepts and tips for low level entertainers ðŸ¥¸

## Welcome

All the content here is `C lang` string features that I've discovered while
coding and/or googling for project related things. I apologize for any
misinformation through this repo! If you prefer, consider sending an Issue/Pull
Request too. It will help a lot!

## Requirements

Since all this stuff is developed with C technology, you'll need:
- A `C` compiler (`gcc`).
- `GNU Make` (since there's a lot of `Makefiles`)
- `bash` (there's `bash` based scripts that works around the Makefile stuff)
- `sudo` privileges, since some scripts use `chmod` (I guess)
